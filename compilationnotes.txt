Hey! This is a remainder that since I am a dum-dum and decided not to learn make
compilation is a bit of a mouthful.

This is how you do it without using a build system like make:

    The commands below compile test1.c and produces an executable file, exe:


        gcc arrlist.c testcomp.c -o exe


    Where arrlist.c is the implementation file for arrlist.h. 

    You have to specify to the compiler the implementation files of your headers to the compiler. 
    Essenetially, the build system automates this for you.

    OH! also, you for this to work, remove both both arrlist.c from the  sub-directory src and make it an inpependent file.
    in the main directory. Atleast on MY Machine, thats how it works
