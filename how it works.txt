stack   *****     
    smaller but fixed    

heap    *********************************
    larger but not fixed

array is limited bcoz its on the stack

linked list is limited becoz access of members is slower

linked_list_node{
    data;
    *next
}

allocate on heap -> head;
head.next -> node1


arraylist 
{
    databuff;       -> array on the heap
    length;         -> number of elements present in the arraylist
    capacity;       -> maximum size of the arraylist
}
